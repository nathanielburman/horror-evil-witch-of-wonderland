# ACT 2
## She meets the witch

This witch emerges.

Saying "I am what nightmares are made of!" and she rips into the dimension fully. Her arms and legs and faces not fully emerged. Suddenly, three eboys emerged around her. Eboy 12, eboy 13, eboy 17 pop out of their bubbles and look around at the egirls who are staring at them. "Come on, I thought we were all witches here." The eboy says as he glances around the room.

The mother witch keeps her eyes on the master cat witch.

She meets the witch and all the cats meet the witch in a epic battle where cats jumped and pounce onto the enemy with their fluffy coats. Portal cats emerge from the shadows and more cats attack the witch.

Portal cat attacks an eboy3 with 100 ap and eboy3 blows up into blood. Another eboy jumps to protect the evil witch! And the portal cat uses their special ability Astral Sear 75 ap for 1 sp. Her special points go down from 12 to 11. Eboy 4 has seen better days. Most normal humans have their age = their level. 
So the logic goes, if your 16 years old, that is also your level. A Portal Cat can hit with attack points and has a health level which matches their age of Earth years basically.

This portal cats special attack rips through the two more eboys standing gaurd infront of the witch and the witch takes a massive hit.

Eyes of the Astral Seer 75ap sp1: Lore: The \"Eyes of the Astral Seer\" are said to see beyond the physical realm. These cats are known as seers and mystics, with eyes that can perceive hidden truths and alternate dimensions. They are revered for their wisdom and insight.\nAbility: \"Eyes of the Astral Seer\" allows the cat to gaze into the future and predict the movements of their foes. It enhances their accuracy and evasion, granting them an advantage in combat.

Sun Portal Master +Player: Solarius the Radiant Sovereign\nLore: Solarius is the Sun Portal Master, capable of harnessing the power of the sun. Their most potent ability, \"Solar Flare Ascension,\" bathes the battlefield in blinding light, strengthening their allies and reducing their enemies to cinders.

Drakon the Abyssal Sovereign\nDrakon is an ancient cat with scales like obsidian. They command the darkest depths of the ocean, guarding the Abyssal Portal to unknown realms.

The witch and her homosexual eboys ran off laughing. The witch turned into darkness.

The maze winded but I want more kittens right now. There were kittens all over the place. The kittens littered the area. And the cats play a different game in wonderland as they escape a doom of their own. Everyone who enters Wonderland knows of the doom that comes for them if they can't escape. Wonderland is an escape room you never escape from.

The maze is a constant stream of data that goes into your eyes every second of the day. Even if you close your eyes in Wonderland, you will see still. There are two mazes in wonderland, one you can see and the other is eyes closed.

There aer lots of little areas in Wonderland no one ever mentions when they get out. Little cubbies and people hiding in little areas that open up into wide new ones. We don't usually go down those paths, because they take days. They take your soul is what they take. Thats why I only go for cat girls. They are special kind of girls that come into Wonderland. Most girls are Alices or Homicidal Alices... and we get bored of those games we play other games on top.

Games like the Off With Her Head Game! Or the Legend of Ragglespankfangs, the dragon that bit too many butts, the dragon council made a decree and said that he would have to eat a princess by twelve oclock noon, high noon or he would be dead.

The dragon was hungry and would just asume eat a princess, but princesses are a dime a dozen around the kingdom. Every girl thinks they are a princess and this completely changes the dimension that a dragon uses to find princesses. So, the dragon flys around a few houses and finds a few princeses. Perfect, plumpy and skinny and juice to the bone. So he gathers up all the princesses and puts them onto the highest peak.

I don't beleive in ragglespanktooth! Me three! Me Four!, Me seven, Me and they just went on forever and ever. I walked away from them when they got to 99. And the path infront of me was still winding. I need to get away from these white meat freaks with meat. I need to get away frmo freaks with white meat. And, I walked onto a main path.

The Queen of Hearts hears of most musing that go around Wonderland. If there was just some way you could get her attention. Maybe you can come up with something real quick.

Will you, Won't you, Join the dance!

The Cat looked mysteriously ahead. She was beautiful. She was a beautiful cat girl. She said she wasn't from Wonderland but shes aware of the stuff that goes on here and there. I am looking for a cat girl. She might be here. I know, that's why I keep coming back. Alice looks good lately. Yes, I noticed that too. Still, this cat girl was perfect.
