Portal cat attacks an eboy3 with 100 ap and eboy3 blows up into blood. Another eboy jumps to protect the evil witch! And the portal cat uses their special ability Astral Sear 75 ap for 1 sp. Her special points go down from 12 to 11. Eboy 4 has seen better days. Most normal humans have their age = their level. 
So the logic goes, if your 16 years old, that is also your level. A Portal Cat can hit with attack points and has a health level which matches their age of Earth years basically.

This portal cats special attack rips through the two more eboys standing gaurd infront of the witch and the witch takes a massive hit.

The maze winded but I want more kittens right now. There were kittens all over the place. The kittens littered the area. And the cats play a different game in wonderland as they escape a doom of their own. Everyone who enters Wonderland knows of the doom that comes for them if they can't escape. Wonderland is an escape room you never escape from.

The maze is a constant stream of data that goes into your eyes every second of the day. Even if you close your eyes in Wonderland, you will see still. There are two mazes in wonderland, one you can see and the other is eyes closed.

The Cat looked mysteriously ahead. She was beautiful. She was a beautiful cat girl. She said she wasn't from Wonderland but shes aware of the stuff that goes on here and there. I am looking for a cat girl. She might be here. I know, that's why I keep coming back. Alice looks good lately. Yes, I noticed that too. Still, this cat girl was perfect.
